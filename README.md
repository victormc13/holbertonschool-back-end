# Pythonic Coding Standards and Introduction to Web Concepts

Welcome to the Pythonic Coding Standards and Introduction to Web Concepts project! This project is designed to enhance your understanding of Pythonic coding conventions while introducing fundamental concepts related to web development. By following the specified requirements, you will not only improve your coding skills but also gain insights into API concepts, REST architecture, and data interchange formats like CSV and JSON.

## Learning Objectives

### General

1. **Bash Scripting Limitations:**
   - Understand the scenarios where Bash scripting should not be used.

2. **API Fundamentals:**
   - Define what an API is and its role in software development.

3. **REST API Concepts:**
   - Explain the concept of a REST API and identify its characteristics.

4. **Microservices Architecture:**
   - Understand the fundamentals of microservices architecture and its advantages.

5. **CSV Format:**
   - Recognize the CSV format and its common use cases.

6. **JSON Format:**
   - Understand the JSON format and its role in data interchange.

7. **Pythonic Coding Standards:**
   - Adhere to Pythonic conventions for package, module, class, variable, function, and constant naming.

8. **CapWords or CamelCase Significance:**
   - Explain the significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python for improved readability and convention.

## Requirements

### General

1. **Editors:**
   - Utilize allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.

2. **Python Version:**
   - Ensure all files are interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.X).

3. **File Structure:**
   - End all files with a new line.
   - The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.

4. **Library Organization:**
   - Organize imported libraries in alphabetical order.

5. **README File:**
   - Include a mandatory README.md file at the project's root.

6. **Coding Standards:**
   - Adhere to the pycodestyle for code formatting.

7. **File Execution:**
   - Ensure all files are executable.

8. **File Length:**
   - Test file length using `wc`.

9. **Module Documentation:**
   - Provide documentation for all modules (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)').

10. **Dictionary Access:**
    - Use the `get` method to access dictionary values by key.

11. **Code Execution Prevention:**
    - Prevent code execution on import (using `if __name__ == "__main__":`).

## Project Structure

The project is organized to help you navigate through different modules and concepts. Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

- **api/:** Contains files related to making requests to API.
- **README.md:** Project description.

Feel free to explore each module, follow the guidelines, and engage with the concepts. If you have any questions or need clarification, don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
